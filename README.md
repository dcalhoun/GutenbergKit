A proof of concept for a Gutenberg editor as a React app embedded in a native iOS app.

## Development

### React App

The ReactJS app is embedded in the native GutenbergKit module.

To launch the app in the browser, run:

```
cd ./ReactApp
npm install // On first use
npm run dev
```

### GutenbergKit

A Swift package with native wrappers for the Gutenberg editor.

### Demo

A host app that can be used to test the changes made to the editor quickly. 

By default, the demo app uses a production build of the React app included in the `GutenbergKit` package. During development, make sure to run the React app and pass the localhost URL as an environment variable of the demo app.

If you are using SwiftUI previews, make sure to point them to the localhost programatically:

```
#Preview {
    NavigationStack {
//        EditorView()
        EditorView(editorURL: URL(string: "http://localhost:5173/")!)
    }
}
```

## Production

To build the React app for production and incorporate the changes in the `GutenbergKit` Swift module, run:

```
./Scripts/build.sh
```
